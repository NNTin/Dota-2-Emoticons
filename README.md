Dota-2-Emoticons
============

Add animated emoticons to your subreddit. Feel free to copy my [stylesheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/LumbdiTest/about/stylesheet/). I didn't upload each emoticon image file individually since Reddit only allows 50 images. I also had to break down the image since Reddit only allows 500k maximum.

### Usage  

1. Put the emoticons you want into the emoticons folder.    
2. Generate the image (generateImage).  
3. Upload the image to your subreddit, think of a good filename.  
4. Generate the css code (generateCode). You have to edit the filename so it matches with the filename on your subreddit.  
5. Paste it into your stylesheet  
6. Save it.  
7. Use generateTest to make a test comment to see if all emoticons are working or not.

Or just copy the images in [this stylesheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/LumbdiTest/about/stylesheet/) over to your subreddit and copy and paste the code. Delete the emoticons lines you do not want. However when new emoticons are added to the game you need to generate them yourselves.
